# KR-quasipolynomial
This is a Mathematica script to compute the dimension quasipolynomials of the Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules.

## Usage
Put the following two files in the same directory :
- `KR_hvector_EFG.dat` : data for h-vectors in type E6,E7,E8,F4,G2 (necessary to define the KR quasipolynomials)
- `KR_quasipolynomial.m` : sample mathematica script to check some properties of the KR quasipolynomials

To run the sample script (assuming that the Mathematica kernel is on your path):
```
$ math -script KR_quasipolynomial.m
```
